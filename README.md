 üõí E-Commerce Data Analysis & Simulation (Python | Google Colab)

üìå Project Overview
This project is an *E-Commerce simulation and analysis system* built using *Python on Google Colab*.  
It demonstrates how products, users, and orders can be handled using *Pandas, Plotly, and CSV/SQL integration*.  
The project provides insights into *sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior, with **interactive visualizations* using Plotly.

‚ú® Key Features
- Simulated product, user, and order datasets
- Add to cart & order placement workflow (code-based)
- Sales analysis and revenue calculation
- Customer purchase behavior insights
- Analyze the profit and loss
- sub category and category profit and sales to profit ratio
- Interactive dashboards and plots using Plotly

 üõ† Tech Stack
- Python 
- Google Colab 
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- SQLite / CSV files

E-commerce database analysis
all questions and answers
Q1 you need to  calculate the monthly sales of the store and identify which month had the highest sales and which month had the lowest sales
Ans=sales_by_month=data.groupby('order month')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()
sales_by_month
order month 11 increse sales
order month 2 is decrese sales

Q2 you need to analyze sales based on product categories and determine which category had the lowest sales and which category has highest sales
Ans=sales_by_category
furniture
technology highest
office supply

Q3 the sales analysis needs to be done based on sabcategories
ans=sales_by_subcategory
highest sales technolgy
sub categories( phones is highest sales)

Q4= you need to analyse the monthly profit from sales and determine which month had the highest profit
Ans= profit_by_month
order month 12 is highest sales month
lowest order month is 2


Q5 Analyze the profit by category and sub-category
Ans=profit_by_category
is technology category 1st
second office workers
3 rd is furniture

profit_by_subcategory
 subcategory highest copires
profit=5561782k
lowest subcategory table
profit=-17.72848k


Q6 analyze the sales and profit by customer segment
ans=consumer highest
corporate
homeoffice

Q7 Analyze the sales to profit ratio
Ans=
consumer highest
corporate
homeoffice

üîÆ Future Improvements
- Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe/Razorpay) for order simulation
- Add machine learning-based product recommendations for users
- Create interactive dashboards with more filters using Plotly or Power BI
- Enable user authentication and profile management
-Deploy the project online using¬†Heroku¬†or¬†AWS
